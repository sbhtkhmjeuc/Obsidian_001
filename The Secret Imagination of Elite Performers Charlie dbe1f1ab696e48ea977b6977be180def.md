- When you imagining that you are doing something, the same parts in the brain are activated when you are actually doing it.
- The more things that you can put in the the visualization process (Sounds, Smells and more) the more you will be able to prepare for the situation.
- Set a Time - need to set a time for Visualization every day.
- Set to Be a Master in what you are doing and Not the out come of it.
