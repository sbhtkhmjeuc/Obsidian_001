**Input** - getting in data.
**Parsing** - the data is getting transferred events, based on a certain rules.
**Indexing** - getting the parsed events and index them for a later use.
**Searching** - in the stage there's a interaction between search-heads and indexers.

Example : 
UF - Universal Forwarder
UF Can be an Agent that is installed on server and collects windows event logs, which after that moves them into an indexer which he than breaks into events and place than in a place that it would be nice for the search head to send requests for,

## Web Splunk interface
when you are restarting the Splunk interface, you need to enable **Boot start**, before you're starting Splunk you can check if Splunk is running and maybe you don't see it by typing in Linux `/opt/splunk/bin/splunk status` which will return the status of Splunk, back to Boot start, you can enable it by typing `/opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start`, after you typed this you still need to start Splunk manually by typing `/opt/splunk/bin/splunk start`.
