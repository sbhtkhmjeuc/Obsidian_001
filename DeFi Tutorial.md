## Welcome to Blockchain
Smart Contracts are self executing sets of instructions, without 3rd parties. But they have a big problem, <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">The Oracle Problem</mark>, the blockchain itself is a deterministic systems which means that everything that is happening in and doesn't connecting to the whole world, but for the smart contracts to have a more capabilities and to do more stuff they have to connect to the outside world, that's where <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Oracles</mark> comes into play, oracles are connecting the world with the smart contract. (but because the Blockchain is Decentralized and the data that they get has to be Decentralized for the Blockchain to continue to be Decentralized).
the Connection between the rest of the world into these smart contracts creates new smart contracts that called <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Hybrid Smart Contracts</mark>.(the large majority of the smart contracts in the world are Hybrid SC's)
<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Chainlink</mark> - is a Oracle protocol that helps you to create Hybrid SC's.

### The Advantages of Blockchain & SC
#### Decentralized
#### Transparency & Flexibility
everybody has to play by the same rules, and everybody can see the whole thing, there are nothing hiding from the users.
#### Speed & Efficiency
the speed of the blockchain, which it gets from it's decentralized entities, so the transactions on the blockchain can be down to 10 min or couple of seconds, depends on the Blockchain that is being used.
#### Security & Immutability
The idea of the blockchain saying that the blockchain it self need to be in all of the members that using it, which means that if you computer is goes down all of the data is held by the other members of the blockchain.
because of the usage in high cryptography and math it's almost impossible to hack the blockchain.
#### Removal of Counterparty Risk
#### Trust Minimized Agreements 
you don't have to trust anyone all you have to look at is the math that is behind all of the agreements because this is a SC which is written in code what you'll get in it's what you'll get out every single time.

### DAO's
*Definition* - Stands for <mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</mark>, are organizations that live on the blockchain.

- Testnet are free and for testing SC.
- Mainnet cost money and are considered "Live".

<mark style="background: #CACFD9A6;">Faucet</mark> - is an application that gives us free test tokens, like test Rinkeby Ethereum.(https://faucet.rinkeby.io/)

Gas is a unit of Computational Measure. The more computation a transaction uses the more "Gas" you'll have to  pay for. Every Transaction that happens on-chain pays a "Gas Fee" to node operators.
