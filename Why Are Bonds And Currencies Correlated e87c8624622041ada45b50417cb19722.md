This phenomenon occurs because capital flows are attracted to higher yielding currencies. As the rate of one currency increases relative to another, investors are attracted to the higher yielding currency. Additionally, the cost of owning the lower yielding currency increase as the bond yield differential moves in favor of the currency that is sold. For example, the cost to owning the Yen and selling the dollar will increase as US bond yields increase relative to Japanese bond yields.”
