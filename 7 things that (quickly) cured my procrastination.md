> ‚Äú***If it your job to eat a frog, it‚Äôs best to do it first thing in the morning‚Äù  -Mark Twain***

Every morning it‚Äôs your job to eat a frog, you can delay it to the next day, but the next you‚Äôll have 2 frogs to eat.

The best thing that you can do id to eat the frog first thing in the morning. This Essentially says that when you have a Big and Scary Task or a Project that you need to do. the best thing is to do it first thing in the morning and get it out of your To-Do list for the day, and it‚Äôs also can help start your other tasks with a big momentum. 

## The 3-2-1 Rule

Whenever you need to do something that you are scared to do or get anxious about, just think on it and count ‚Äú3-2-1‚Äù and go do that task the best you can. 

## The ‚ÄúDo-Something‚Äù Principle (by Mark Manson)

Most people thinking that is the path to action :

 $Insperation\rightarrow Motivation \rightarrow Action$ 

but action isn‚Äôt the effect that come from motivation but also the cause. The Drawing Above isn‚Äôt in a straight line but it‚Äôs a loop, **you can start when you want to start**.  

But the Q Now is : ‚ÄúHow Do I Take Action Without Inspersion & Motivation ?‚Äù The Answer is **Habit**, when you have a habit you act without having any pre-thought on it. 

The Next time that you don‚Äôt want to do nothing, **Just Do Something**, and harness the reaction from the action to generate the motivation to take further action.

## Stare at one thing for 60-seconds

when you are lacking focus and you want to focus to do something, stare on something for 60-seconds in the same distance that you are going to do that thing in, and in the end of that 60 seconds, your focus collects itself.

‚ÄúWhen we focus with our eyes, we focus with our brain‚Äù.

## Confront Your Distractions Before Working

**Usually good to do at the end of the day** (after you have eaten the frog in the morning.)

Set a Timer and browse through all of the distraction that you maybe having in all of the day, thus checking off all of the distraction one by one and clearing you‚Äôre mind for it.
