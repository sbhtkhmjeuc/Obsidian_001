# What you can do to improve yourself ?

- **Why should you even bother improving yourself ?** and the answer to that is **wonâ€™t suffer anymore stupidly than you have to**.
- If you wonâ€™t organize yourself properly **YOUâ€™LL PAY FOT IT, IN A BIG WAY**. you can say that you are not care about that, but you do because when youâ€™ll be in pain you will do everything in your power to stop the suffering and pain, which you can do if youâ€™ll start earlier.
- **How I can get in act together ?** and the answer to that is **Look around for something that bothers you and see how you can fix it**.
- You need to ASK, I want to do ____ better, what should I do ?
- Fix the things that you repeat every day, all of your routines are making up about 50% of your life.
- **Not everything that presents itself to you that is in need to repair, itâ€™s doesn't mean that is YOU right than and there that need to repair them.**
- As soon as you give the mind an **aim**, the world will re-contract itself that you will keep with your aim.
- **You see what you aim at. â†’ Be Carful What you aim at.**
- **If the world manifests itself to you in a negative way â†’ What you aim at and Re-Configure it.** But an important to remember is that life has a random element in it.
