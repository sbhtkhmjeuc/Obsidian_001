3 Points for Calisthenics Starters :

- **Control your movement**
    
    Do a Full Range of Motion in Every Exercise, **Train all of the muscles that are engaged in the exercise,** For Example, in push-ups, you need the scapula muscles, and training them will give you more reps and more power when you are doing push-ups. 
    
- **Build up core strength**
    
    the most important muscle in the body to preform calisthenics well is the **Core**, so train it well.
    
- **Do progressive movements**
    
    when you start a new exercise, try first do all itâ€™s progression, these will allow you to train the muscles, and do the exercise well with full range of motion and lowering the possibility for injuries and such.
