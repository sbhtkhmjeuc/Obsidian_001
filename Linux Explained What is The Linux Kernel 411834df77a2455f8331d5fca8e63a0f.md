linux isn’t an OS because it’s doesn't do those two things , it’s one of the components of OS, which is the **Kernel** 

*Definition* : this is the core of the OS, it’s the first program to load on startup. What the kernel Does is :

- Handle the rest of the start-up process
- Handle the input/output requests from other programs
- Manages Memory and hardware peripherals (keyboard, Monitors, printers, speakers and more...)
