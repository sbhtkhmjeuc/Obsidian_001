## Intro to Splunk 
the things that Splunk can do :
- Index Data - getting the data as a raw material and figuring out how to process it, and to break it down to single events which are timestamped, which than get stored in the Index
- Search & Investigate - after the indexing part now all of the events are in the Splunk index and we can search them and investigate them incase we need too   
- Add Knowledge - you add "Labels" to your data which can be helpful when you need to analyst the events 
- Monitor & Alert - you can set alerts for Splunk based on rules that you set to notify you if any goes wrong.   
- Report & Analyze - after all of the data is in the index, you can create reports and analyze the data for different uses.
