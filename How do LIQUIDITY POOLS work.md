<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">LIQUIDITY POOLS are market makers for DEX's</mark> 

to create a new liquidity pool you have to have a two tokens (DAI/ETH) for example, all of the LP's (Liquidity provider) have to contribute the save amount in value that the amount of the two token in value will be equal, that because if not the price that will be created will different from the global price, which create an option for arbitrage.

the LP's after contributing for the pool getting back a LP Token (Each LP and their token) proportionate for how much liquidity they provided, all of the pool getting 0.3% fee that is distributed among all of the LP's.

Each pool is a market that work with it's on AMM (Automated Market Maker)

The bigger the pool the lesser the price impact on the pool and thus the less slippage, that is why "Balancer" is giving higher tokens for LP to put their tokens in smaller pools, that is called <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Liquidity Mining</mark>.
