there's a problem between the more modern OS's and the BIOS because the BIOs Communicates with 16-bits and the new OS are communication in 32 or 64 bits.

the UEFI Allow for bigger disks to be recognized, which the BIOS doesn't.

you can see in the Computers Partitions that is have a "EFI"
partition which means that the UEFI can load more info than what it has on it's chip.
