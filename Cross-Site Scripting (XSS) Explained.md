**SOP** - Same origin policy, a security feature that stops one site to read or write into or from an9other website.
the SOC checks 3 thing to allow Read or Write: <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Protocol, Host and Port</mark> 
in this example (‚¨áÔ∏è) we can see that the the protocol is the same, but the host is different, so the SOP blocks.

We can inject JS into another website and take control over the HTML Files (via DOM API's), and steal CRSF tokens and read cookies to use them.

### Example 
let's take for example a text box that when you type your name it's changes the name above (that is HTML). Let's see what comes after we clicked on the button, the client sends a GET Request with the name, the server checks that and sending back a HTML code for the browser to present. Because we know that the server sends the info in HTML code, we can add things and manipulate the system and get back a lot more things.
For example, if we'll type a script line (that let's us run JavaScript inside an HTML) we'll be able to set something to jump up (‚¨áÔ∏è)

## Types
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Reflected XSS</mark> - occur when a malicious script is reflected off of a web application to the victim‚Äôs browser.
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Stored XSS</mark> - the output can be also stored, and viewed on the attacker side. (for example a Comment in YouTube, the comment is stored in a database and every one who sees that will be effected)
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">DOM XSS</mark> - it's when a user's input lands in the JS Code. (happens entirely on the client side)
<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Mutation XSS</mark> - the user input gets changed by the browser before getting into the DOM, which can lead into a Crash.
## Prevention
**DomPurify** - is a library the sanitizes the unsafe JS and spits out the safe JS.
