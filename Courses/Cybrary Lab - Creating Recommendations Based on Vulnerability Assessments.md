---

## Confirm devices in provided IP range and create target list

1. we needed to know in which network we’re in, and by running `ifocnfig` we can see all of the networks that the current machine is a part from
2. after that we saw that we are part of the `192.168.0` network, we need to run `nmap` to see all of the devices on thew network, to do that we need to type `nmap -sT -F 192.168.0.0/24` (`-sT` - Scan Type parameter used to conduct TCP Connect scan. `-F` - Option parameter used for a "Fast" or "limited port" scan)
3. after we need to store that in a file for Full Analysis later, we can do that by adding the `-oG` to the end of the current command followed by the storing path. (**`-oG`****
 - Outputs and saves the file in the present directory)
4. `namp` gave us all the info including the open port of each IP Address, you can delete those of you want.

## Run a vulnerability assessment & Perform risk assessment on findings and determine mitigation actions

1. now we have the target list, and we can preform a vulnerability assessment on those IP Address, we need to use the OpenVas tool, to start it you need to run in the terminal `openvas-start` command.
2. after you entered to the dashboard, you now need to create a net Tasks with the IP Address, and run it, after it will finish you’ll need to download the report and read trough it.

## Perform risk assessment on findings and determine mitigation actions
