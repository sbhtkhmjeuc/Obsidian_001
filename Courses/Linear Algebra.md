# Linear Algebra
Type : #t/Collage-Course 


the calculations will be preformed on the number (R) and complex numbers (C)

a group needs to be represented in a capital letter, and each of the group’s item can be represented in a `{}` , For Example : A = {1,2,3}.

when you say that an item is belong to a group you write, x**∈A.** 

the numbers in R will be a collection that built from :

- Natural Numbers (N) (1,2,3,...)
- Whole Numbers (Z) (-2,-10,5,8,...)
- Rational numbers(Q) that are a portion of the division of the whole numbers $m/n$  (n≠0)

- Non - Rational numbers, the numbers that you can’t represent by a division like π , $\sqrt{2}$ and more.

## Settings

let’s take for example the equation $-3x_1+4x_2+x_3-x_4=7$, the number -3,4,1,-1 are the coefficients, and the number 7 is the free coefficient.

to represent an Equations System we’ll use double indices representation and the coefficient of a $X_j$ in a $I$ Equation, you will represent in $X_{ij}$.

there are 2 kinds of function systems : 
**Homogeneous linear** - this a system that the free variables are 0
**Non-homogeneous linear** - at least one of the free variable isn't 0.
