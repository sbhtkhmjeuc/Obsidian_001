OS Injections tools : **[Commix](https://github.com/commixproject/commix/wiki/)**
## Creating a BackDoor
**Weevely** (weaponize web shell) / **Metasploit**
you need to create a exposed file using Weevely, and upload in into the server / host that you want a backdoor to, after that we access to the server trough the weevely backdoor that we setup.
## Defending at the application layer
### Avoid calling OS Commands directly
use API calls instead of shell commands 
### Escape values added to OS commands specific to each OS
Disarm Potentially harmful commands from user-input, you can use two functions that checks the text that the user is inputting and doesn't let him pass more than one command / parameter.
### Parameterization & Input Validation 
when you build the website you know the input that you're expecting from the user, based on that info you can build a program in your code that will check for bad input that can cause a hacking into the systems.
