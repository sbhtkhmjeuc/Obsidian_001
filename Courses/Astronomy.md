- Assignment No.1 : Science, Past & Future.
    
    Q:
    
    - *In terms of the scientific method, how does astronomy differ from a lab science like chemistry or biology? How can astronomers be confident of their understanding of objects that are remote from the Earth?*
    - *Ancient cultures built some impressive structures that incorporated astronomical functions and information (Stonehenge, Chichen Itza, the Great Pyramid). A friend or acquaintance of yours tries to argue that some of these structures and artifacts are evidence of "ancient astronauts" or visits by intelligent aliens. How would you rebut or argue against this idea?*
    
    A:
    
    - the astronomers are conducting experiments by the theory that they thought of and analysing the results to see what they got, and if the results are matching their theory, the theory is probably right.
    - First I'll ask him for evidence and I will examine those evidence by logic and mental-experiments, After this I'll explain him my side and give evidences, and we both debut these problem and get to a logical solution.
    
- Ancient Astronomy
    
    
- Calenders
- Lunar Cultural Connections
    - The moon is a very respectful symbole in the Islamic culture. For Ex the Ramadan is Starting when the Metazoan observes the crescent moon (סהר ירח).
    - The Islamic curture is keeping there time by the moon.
    - In ancient Egypt the seasons were based on the flodding of the Nile.
    - the crescent moon on the flag on the islamic countries is representing the festival (the Ramadan).
    - Because the islamic used the Lunar Calender, every year there calnder will shift 11 days.
    - Q : Why our year Starts in January ?
        
        There is no good Explanetions for this, you don't have to start on January, the Earth is moving in an orbit around the sun so it's dosen't matter when you start because you will end in the same point. 
        
        by the Mental Floss : "looking forward and one looking back. Julius Caesar thought it would be appropriate for January, Janus's namesake month, to be the doorway to a new year, and when he created the Julian calendar"
        
    - the Seconds are invention of the Babylonians, We don't know how they got the idea for 60-base Numbering
    - Q : Why The Clock is Moving In clock-wise and not the other way ?
        
        the first clock was in the area of Germany today' that was a giant bell that tells to the solders when to go to the field and when get back from it, and because Germany is above the Middle-line of the Earth and the sun moves (relative to them) from left to right. 
        
    - the Pagan holidays are still celebrated in many parts of the world, for example Halloween is one of the Pagan's Holidays.
- Greek Science
    - How the Greeks knew that the Earth Was Round ?
        
        the Greek Philosophies understood how the Earth is round by looking at the moon and see that the shadow the earth is Projecting on the moon is Round, and the only Geometric shape that moves by any angle and always project a Circle is a Sphere.
        
    - Why the Greeks were Coming up with all of there ideas ?
        
        Unlike all of the other Cultures how just were looking for patterns, The Greeks were trying to make a principal or a law. 
        
        for Example : the Egyptians were using the law of Pythagoras to Build a perfect Triangles for the Nile, but the Greeks took the this principal and make it a abstract law (a^2+b^2=c^2)
        
    - How the Greeks knew the size of the earth ?
        
        They went to a place which didn't have shadow on it, then there went to another place which did have shadow on it, the angle between the two places on the surface of the earth was 7-Degrees, which was 50th of the earth diameter (360) ,and was 800 km,  with multiplication was that the earth size is : 41,000 km 
        
    - How Democritus Thought on the Atom ?
        
        He imagined a sharp knife and a stone. You cut the stone into smaller and smaller pebbles until it becomes a grain of sand. And then perhaps you can do the experiment but you imagine cutting it in half and half and half again until it's almost too small to see on a tip of your finger.
        
        Now you can do the experiment, but the thought experiment continues. And how does it end? To democratize, there are only two outcomes. Either you reach a fundamental invisible indivisible object, he called it an atom. or you carry on the process forever generating infinitely small subunits. this approach of infinite Small subunits is was logical to him so he went with the atom. 
        
- Copernican Revolution
    - What is the Geocentric model ?
        
        a model that believes that the earth is the center of the universe, and perfected by Ptolemy.
        
    - What is the Retrograde Motion ?
        
        It's when the Planet Appears to travel in the opposite direction for several days. that happened because the earth moved faster that Jupiter, which seems like the star is moving backwards.

    - What the idea of Nicolas Copernicus ?
        
        that the earth was not the center of the universe. but moving around the sun, and coming with the "the heliocentric model", with that thinking all of the problems with the Geocentric model will disappear 
        
    - What is the problem with the the heliocentric model ?
        
        the problem was that if Copernicus was right and the earth is moving around the sun, the positions of the stars needs to shift as the earth goes around the sun. 
        
        the solution for this problems is that the shift is accruing but because the stars where very far away **(which indicates that the universe is very very large)** and where no telescopes at the time, and there was no way to validate the Heliocentric model. 
        
    - Why Copernicus's Book was so revolutionary ?
        
        by the Geo-Cristian Religion there was a pact between humans and there creators that the universe should be build around us, and we should be the center of the universe. and with the Heliocentric model, that meant we are just orbiting another star just like other rocky objects in the space, that we are not special in any way, which rocked the religions world at the time.
        
    - Who is Kepler ?
        
        Kepler was a assistance to Brahe (A Dane Rich Man Who had a observatory at the time) as the time goes on Kepler got his hand on Brahe's Data' which later help him to make his Brilliants ideas.
        
- Kepler
    
    ***the Laws of Kepler of Planetary Motions*** - 
    
    - the orbit of the Earth is Elliptical, with the sun in one end and nothing in the other.
    - Law of Equal Areas - the Earth is moving faster when it closer to the sun and moving slower when it far from the sun.
    - the Orbital Period squared is equal to the triple average distance from the sun

    which Approved that the Copernicus model is the right one.
    
- Galileo
    - What are the Three Objections of Galileo ?
        - the Motion of the Earth - By the Calculations the Earth needs to be in Motion, but No Motion in apparent.
        - Spheres and Circles - the Universe Needs to be Build from Spheres and Circles because it is a Perfect Shape.
        - If the Earth is in Motions why the Stars don't Change their Brightness in certain positions.
    - what were the Solutions ?
        - Galileo Conducted an experiment, he took a man and place him on a bottom of a sailing boat on a smooth surface, if there was no windows the man can't no what the ship was is motion or not.
        - Galileo showed with his Telescope the the sun was not perfect she had a sun-spots, and the moon have vales and mounters
        - Galileo showed with his telescope that the as the sun brighter he his closer and as he Dimmer he is more far away, that idea gave to Galileo the understanding that the universe is 3D space.
    - Galileo finds that the nature of the object can't change his acceleration.
    - How Galileo confirmed the Heliocentric / Copernicus's Model ?
        
        Galileo observed Venus, and saw that Venus can be saw in Phases (which proved the Heliocentric Model), if the motion was is the Geocentric motion Venus needs to be seen to Galileo with no Phases at all. 
        
    - How Galileo Got Funded for his Telescope Research ?
        
        Galileo didn't Get Funded in the area of his first university, than Galileo went to Venice, when a the time was the Richest city in Europe, and sell the Telescope for rich man as a Device that will help them to see ships earlier than the people on the land.

- The Naked Eye
    - How many constellations of stars there are ?
        
        around a 110
        
    - the constellations have no meaning at all, every culture have it is own meaning and story for the constellations.
    - the stars that making the constellations are usually very far apart for each other, from the sun and earth, they seem like they next to each other because of the angels.
    - When you are in the North Pole and you looking on the rotation of the stars, the stars will go around a point above your head. the same is when you are in the South pole but in this time the rotation of the stars will be the other way around.
    - if you are not is North or the South pole, and you want to calculate the angles which the stars are moving relative to the point above your head, you will to consider Three Things :
        - Eclipse - is in an angle of the Earth rotation relative to the Sun's plane (23.5 Degrees)
        - Celestial Sphere - is a sphere that surrounded that earth relative to it.
        - Equator - is a projection of Earth's Equator into space.  and it's placed vertical to the Earth rotation axis.
        
- Daily Motion
    
    Sidereal Day -  a day Measured by the rotation of the stars around the earth, this day equals to 23H 56M 4S 
    
    Solar Day - a day Measured by the rotation of the sun around the earth, this day equals to 24H
    
    - Why there are a Difference between the two days ?
        
        the shifting between the two day is accruing because the earth is moving around which means that for the earth to be in the same line with the sun after he moved around him self he needs to to a 361 rotation angle to be in the same position inline to the sun. this shift is adding 4m to the sidereal day.
