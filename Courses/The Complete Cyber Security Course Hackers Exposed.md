# The Threat and Vulnerability Landscape

***Pseudonymity*** - False identity. (For Example, Creator of Bitcoin)

## Security, Vulnerabilities, Threats & Adversaries

![5. Security, Vulnerabilities, Threats and Adversaries_Moment.jpg](The%20Complete%20Cyber%20Security%20Course%20Hackers%20Exposed%20a8252d85c5fc4c87bbabd5dfe7215dbe/5._Security_Vulnerabilities_Threats_and_Adversaries_Moment.jpg)

you’re using **Security** to protect your **Assets** (Files, Accounts and more... ) from **Threats** that sent by **Adversaries.**

$$
Risk = Vulnerabilities * Threats* Consequences
$$

***Threat Landscape Or Model*** - based on you own threat, you will need to implement a Security. 

## Assets Selection

Assets = Valuables 

the Assets are depending on the client, each client and their assets.

Function can also be a asset (for example the “Login” Function of the Bank website)

picking the right assets to protect you can use the “**Rick Assessments Methods**”

## Threat Modeling and Risk Assessments

**You can’t ever have 100% security** 

You Need to take a Risk Approach, to do that you’ll need to do:

### **Threat Modeling and Risk Assessments**

1. We already said that : $Risk = Vulnerabilities * Threats* Consequences$. 
2. You need to have a list of assets that you want to protect.
3. Think on Vulnerabilities, Threats and Adversaries that you can face in the Journey (to do that you’ll need to know your enemy better)
4. **Concentrate on Consequences** in order to determine that defensive mechanism that you need to use.

Example : Protecting you Computer, the Adversary would be a black hat hacker, the Vulnerability would be the data on the computer and the Consequences are identity theft. Based on your **tolerance for risk** you would apply security controls (you should apply security control for the biggest risks **FIRST.**)

## Security vs Privacy vs Anonymity

> T*he amount of privacy and anonymity you require is directly proportional to the amount of security you need*
> 

## Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability - (Security Attributes)

### CIA Triad

To consider the type of security control that we might need, you need to think about the assets need for **Confidentiality , Availability & Integrity.**

**Confidentiality -** to authorize access to only people or programs that we want. 

**Availability -** we prefer the wellbeing upon the integrity of the asset (shouldn’t be deleted)

**Integrity -** we prefer the wholesome of the assets upon it’s wellbeing (shouldn’t be modified)

**to each client, security is different.**

### Parkerian Hexad

in addition of the 3 security attributes of the CIA Triad, this model add 3 more attributes :

**Utility -** Usefulness (Encrypted data)

**Possession -** (Control), a loss of control but not loss of Confidentiality (Phishing)

**Authenticity -** veracity of the claim of origin of the asset (can be stolen but can’t be proved that it was stolen)

There are couple of more Security Attributes that are well known:

**Non-Repudiation** - one party of a transaction cannot deny the completion of the transaction.

**Authorization** - the permission of the particular asset.

**Authentication** - the claiming of the asset to be who said he is.

## Defense in Depth

L**ayers of Defense**, there are three main of defenses:

**Prevention** -  prevent un-necessary access of unwanted people into the assets.

**Detect** - some-type of trap that a person or malware can activate in a moment of hacking

**Recover** - Back-up, recovering of the stolen data in case of stealing.

![10. Defense In Depth_Moment.jpg](The%20Complete%20Cyber%20Security%20Course%20Hackers%20Exposed%20a8252d85c5fc4c87bbabd5dfe7215dbe/10._Defense_In_Depth_Moment.jpg)

## Zero Trust

### T**he lower your trust the better the security will be.**

Distributes the Trust 

if it’s important, have another protection layer.

## Security Bugs (Vulnerabilities) - The Vulnerability Landscape

*Definition* - it’s an error that is written into the software, that can be use be a hacker to exploit it.

**bugs can be everywhere, as long as humans developing them.**

There are two type of bugs : **Known & Unknown (Zero Days) .**(when a bug is know you can download a patch and it will cover the bug up and “remove” it from the software)

The hacker uses Exploit kits to make the bug it’s favor, but nowadays the usage of exploit kits are on decline because more of the hacker are using “Social Engineering”.  

[exploit-db.com](http://exploit-db.com)  - a Database for Exploits

## Malware, viruses, rootkits and RATs

*Malware* -  software designed to interfere with a computer's normal functioning.

Type of malware : 

**Micro Virus** - a virus that is runs on a micro language (VBS),  a lot of programs will to run the virus automatically because it will embedded into the code of the program, For Example Word and Excel Files.

**Stealth Virus** -  hides the modifications that he made and feeds the OS false data to seem like it’s all ok.

**Polymorphic Virus -**  changing all the time (almost never look the same in each attack), make it very hard to detect

**Self-Garbling Virus** - it will change the encoding of its own code to trick antivirus programs and stay hidden.

**Bots & Zombies** - a collection. operates on a command control by the hacker.

**Worms** - Spreading from one machine to another.

**OS Rootkits** - one the worst, it usually embedded to the kernel of the OS, so it’s very hard to trace, and also can hide itself almost completely from the OS.

**Firmware rootkit** -  (hardware rootkit) the worst of all, typically aims to infect a computer’s hard drive and basic input/output system (BIOS), the software installed onto a small memory chip in the motherboard.

**Key Logger** -  logging your key strokes.

**Trojan** - seems to be one thing, but it’s a malware. 

**Remote Access Tools (RAT)**- like TeamViewer for the Hacker.

**Spyware -** spying on the persons computer and send the info back to the hacker. 

**Adware** - software that forced ad’s on you.

**Scareware** - social Engineering attack, by letting the person believing that there is an attack when in the real world nothing is there. (For example, an un-real problem that if you want to fix you’ll need to pay to someone)

**Potentially Unwanted Programs (PUP’s)** - when you are downloading an software, PUP is an addition that you doesn't wanted to download, but it got downloaded Despite that.

## The Most Popular

**Ransomware** - Phishing

**Malvertisement**- Ad’s that are Malware

**Drive-by Attack** - visiting a website that has a code that can exploit your machine.

## Phishing, Vishing and SMShing

***Phishing** Definition -* targets are contacted by email, telephone or text message by someone posing as a legitimate institution to lure individuals into providing sensitive data such as personally identifiable information, banking and credit card details, and passwords.

### Phishing Techniques -

Link Manipulation - fake links that hides the real location. 

Hidden Links - the link is written correctly, but the destination isn’t real. (using HTML / Word)

Stealing Scripts - like stealing credit cards info by the post-office.

### Vishing

A form of phishing using a telephone call to the prospective victim

### SMShing

SMShing shing is a form of phishing in which an attacker uses a compelling text message to trick targeted recipients into clicking a link and sending the attacker private information or downloading malicious programs to a smartphone.

## Spam & Doxing

**Spam** - Unsolicited e-mail, often of a commercial nature, sent indiscriminately to multiple mailing lists, individuals, or newsgroups; junk e-mail.

**Doxing** - doxing is a malicious act, used against people with whom the hacker disagrees or dislikes.

## Social Engineering

*Definition* : Social engineering is a manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain private information, access, or valuables. Examples : Phishing, Fake Prizes, Refund or Recovery scams, Fake Technical Supports sales, Collage Scholarship scams, Fake online dating scams, **Basically every one who you don’t know that asks for money**. 

## CPU Hijackers

it’s a malware that Hijacks your CPU Cycles to mine cryptocurrencies.

JS mining based mining tools, for example PirateBay. 

there are also CPU Hijackers on android, using popups to run the code.

## Darknets, Dark Markets and Exploit kits

AKA the DarkNet, un like the internet (the Clear Net).

how the exploit kit is working, some one buys the exploit kit, uploads it to a hacked website, and if the visitor don’t have any Patches or Defensive mechanisms the code runs and does what he need to do.

## Regulating encryption, mandating insecurity & legalizing spying

> **Complexity is the nemesis of security**
> 

*Formal Methods -* Formal methods are techniques used to model complex systems as mathematical entities. By building a mathematically rigorous model of a complex system, it is possible to verify the system's properties in a more thorough fashion than empirical testing. 

### Back Doors

*Definition* - Weakening of a system

they can be created by a human error by accident or on prepose by advisory.

is a assets is closed source the only ways to find vulnerabilities is by use **Reverse Engineering.** 

*Reproducible Builds* - a set of software development practices that create an independently-verifiable path from source to binary code.

## Cyber Threat Intelligence

# Encryption

*Definition* - Encryption scrambles plain text into a type of secret code that hackers, cybercriminals, and other online snoops can't read, even if they intercept it before it reaches its intended recipients. 

[Asymmetric Encryption - Simply explained](https://app.videonotebook.com/notebooks/4487c9cb-f7a8-44af-b8a8-57a93d1b4b74/video/44f43bf8-ccc1-49e1-9b1c-01a4afcb462d)

## Symmetric Encryption

There are two components to Encryption, **Algorithm (Public) & Key (Private)**, for example ***256-bit AES***

**AES** - Symmetric Encryption (uses 1 Key), then you have to write a password (which will be the key), the larger the number of bits the better the encryption, but it’s also slower to encrypt and decrypt. 

*Brute Forcing attack  -* trying to guess every combination of the key 

*Dictionary Attack -* trying to guess the key from a list of potential passwords.

you can also take the both attacks and marge them together, using a understanding of the human behavior. 

**Other Encryption Algos :**

- Data Encryption Standard (**DES**)
- Triple-DES (**3DES**)
- **BlowFish**
- **RC4**
- **RC5**
- **RC6**
- Advanced Encryption Standard (**AES**)

## Asymmetric Encryption

**Uses 2 keys (Private & Public)**, unlike the Symmetric Encryption that uses the 1 keys.

**Examples for Asymmetric Encryption Key Algos :**

- Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (**RSA**)
- Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (**ECC**)
- Diffie-Hellman (**DH**)
- **El Gamal**

**Benefits** : Digital Signatures, Key Exchange & Agreement  

***if you are encrypting with one key, you need the other key to decrypt it.*** 

For Example, you are the Sender, and you encrypts with the **receiver Public Key**,  that means that you are want *Confidentiality*, only the person that have the key can read the message, but there isn’t any *Authentication* because anyone can encrypt with the public key (because it’s public). But if you are the sender and you are encrypting with **your own Private Key**, you want *Authentication*, because the receiver know that it’s you that send it (because only you are possess you own private key), But because you are encrypted it with your own private key *Confidentiality* isn’t assure in this case. 

**Security Services that can be used by using Encryption :** 

- Confidentiality
- Authentication
- Non-Repudiation
- Integrity

Asymmetric Vs Symmetric :

Asymmetric : 

- Better Key Distribution
- Scalability
- Authentication & Non-Repudiation
- Slow
- Mathematically Intensive

Symmetric :

- Fast & Strong

**For Example, 1024-bit RSA keys are equivalent in strength to 80-bit symmetric keys** 

## Hash Functions

*Definition* : converts strings of different length into fixed-length strings known as hash values or digests. You can use hashing to scramble passwords into strings of authorized characters for example. The output values cannot be inverted to produce the original input.

you are providing an **Input**, to the hush functions and getting a **Digest.** 

Once you change even one character in the file or the string that you providing, the hush output is changed

**Examples for Hash Functions :**

- MD2, MD4,MD5
- HAVAL
- SHA, SHA-1, SHA-256,SHA-384,SHA-512
- Tiger

**HMAC** - Hash-Based Message authentication code

[HMAC explained | keyed hash message authentication code](https://app.videonotebook.com/notebooks/4487c9cb-f7a8-44af-b8a8-57a93d1b4b74/video/b37a2050-9ce5-463a-ad00-577d71ccec52)

## Digital Signatures

*Definition* - is a hash value that is encrypted by the private key of the sender.

Provides - **Authentication, Non-repudiation and Integrity**.

## SSL Stripping

Proxy Explanation Video : [Video "What is a Proxy?" | Video Notebook](https://app.videonotebook.com/notebooks/4487c9cb-f7a8-44af-b8a8-57a93d1b4b74/video/918ff2af-2269-491f-8c3d-248dbab1bd22)

Do to that attack you have to be the middle man between the client and the server to proxy the transmission (the middle man can be the entity that controls the connection device  that you use to surf the internet, for example the router in the café or even the government)

the attacker can be the middle man **Physically or Wirelessly** (by physically sitting between you and the server, or to trick your machine to move all your network to go through them, by being the default gateway)

[ARP Poisoning | Man-in-the-Middle Attack](https://app.videonotebook.com/notebooks/4487c9cb-f7a8-44af-b8a8-57a93d1b4b74/video/da83c1e9-433e-40c9-9ce5-99cf62847aea)

**Rouge Access Point** - it’s unauthorized access point to you network   ****

To mitigate this from, the client side, you can use a “Tunnel” to secure the networking activity from the server the client, you can use **VPN** or **SSH**. 

to prevent ARP Spoofing you can use VLAN’s or physically separate the connections 

## HTTPS

**HTTPS** - is the HTTP protocol that turns over a Security Layer (TLS or SSL)

**Handshake** - Authentication of both sides Client & Server. ([SSL/TLS handshake Protocol](https://app.videonotebook.com/notebooks/4487c9cb-f7a8-44af-b8a8-57a93d1b4b74/video/911f7a2a-ae51-49b4-8a17-4d77925d2f89))

[ssllabs.com](http://ssllabs.com)  - website that analysis the Encryption of a certain site 

HSTS - is a service in the server side that forces that client to talk on “HTTPS” if can be done

Server Name Indication (SNI) -  enables to the client side to present the Server Name that it’s trying to connect to.  

## Digital Certificates

*Definition* - TLS certificate is a kind of digital certificate (or public key certificate/ identity certificate) issued by the Certificate Authority. The certifying authority authenticates the certificate by signing it, certifying that it belongs to a particular domain name which is the subject of the certificate. 

**X.509** - the standard that is defines the format of public key certifications. (Poor Designed)

the digital certification is contains the public key, if we are encrypting a message using the RSA method and the Public Key that is been provided to us means that only the entity that has the private key, in this case the server, can decrypt the message that we sent.

Chain of Trust - is a list to verify the root cert the browser is trusting a CA (Certs Authority)

## CA & HTTPS

HTTPS is relaying on the CA.

if there is a Vulnerability on the CA, the HTTPS security isn’t worth anything.

Too much trusted Parties

problem in issue process of the certs

## End-to-End Encryption (E2EE)

- ZRTP
- OTR
- SSL/TLS
- PGP

## Steganography

*Definition -* the art or practice of concealing a message, image, or file within another message, image, or file.

the file that is carrying the data is called the “**Carrier**”, the file will look exactly like the original but with a hidden message.

# Operating System Security & Privacy

## Security Features and Functionality

*Definition* - software that controls the operation of a computer and directs the processing of programs (as by assigning storage space in memory and controlling input and output functions)

there isn’t perfect OS

### Windows -

Weak Security Design in the beginning, but along the way Microsoft is developing it’s security. Privacy issues

### Mac OS -

More Secure than windows, but have less security features (which means that Apple is responsible for everything unlike windows when you can customize things yourself)

### Linux -

Most Secure OS Platform, that have the most secure OS building on it. 

## Security Bugs and Vulnerabilities

The more security features an OS have, doesn't means that it more secure in the real world.

## Physical & Hardware Isolation

### MAC Address

Physical Address → MAC Address (Unique Number)

[https://technitium.com/tmac/](https://technitium.com/tmac/) - MAC Address Changer for Windows

Macchanger - MAC Address changer for Linux

### Hardware Serials

**CPU** - for the CPU there’s not anything unique that you need to worry about, 

you can use the [CPU-Z](https://www.cpuid.com/softwares/cpu-z.html) for windows to check all of the things that the CPU can tell anyone else. 

In linux you can use [I-NEX](https://launchpad.net/i-nex) does the same as the software above. 

**MotherBoard** -  not all the time the motherboard contains an identifier,  you can see id you have trough the terminal by typing : “dmidecode -t” will give you the option that you can get

**HardDrive** - using the lshw in linux, and typing “sudo lshw -class disk” you will be able to see the serial number of your disk.

when you are in a VM you don’t need to be worry about those serial Numbers

## Virtual Isolation

Example of Encryption and Compartmentalization, by creating a NAS with separate volumes, that are encrypted with different keys, and contains different level’s of important data 

you can use hidden encrypted volume (use the **Elliptic Curve Diffie- Hellman**) different session keys.

[https://portableapps.com/](https://portableapps.com/) - for Virtual Isolation, stand alone apps that nor required instillation. the app itself can be contained in an encrypted NAS Volume or Encrypted USB Key. 

Because the apps are in the USB key (For Example) you can just insert the USB into another computer and continue surfing from there in the same profile.

## VM for Isolation & Compartmentalization

**KVM** 

**Linux-Containers**

Jails

Docker

**turnkey linux** 

**Kasm** (above) 

## VM Weaknesses

**keeping the Host safe is more important,** because is someone can get to the Host he can break the isolation between the Host and the Guest.

but the Guest can also expose the Host id there are any Vulnerabilities inside of the VM Software or Problem with the Configuration settings. 

For Example **Venom**, the step are adversary exploits VENOM to escape VM.  

## VM Hardening

**Physical Hardening** - other physical computer that will be the regular use and another one for privacy and with all the security

you can use also VLAN to isolate the guest computer.

**Leak Protect** - the guest can see the files of the host in there environment, to disable this you can encrypt the host disk or partition so the that guest won’t have access to it.

**Delete Cache for the Guest**

**Disable to Audio / Microphone / Camera**

## Whonix
