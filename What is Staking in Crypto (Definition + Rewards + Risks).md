*Basic Definition* : is a blockchain verification method that is much more energy efficient and less risky than the more common proof of work method, only one miner is chosen at a time to validate the blockchain but that miner must lock up some of their coins as collateral, to be chosen the miner is punished for creating any fraudulent transactions by losing their collateral and rewarded for good transactions by the creation of new coins and possibly with the transaction fees the senders paid.

### Proof-Of-Work vs Proof-Of-Stake 
the proof of work method can be though of like a race which everyone that signs up can participate in, but some participants can have an advantage over other participants, for example more strength, more stronger legs and more, and the person that is finishing first gets the reward, while all the others were giving resources (that usually costs money) and got mothing. 
But in Proof-Of-Stake, is more cost and power efficient and more friendly for the participants, each one of the participants have to set a collateral (which the use we'll see later) ,only one of the participants is called every time that there is a calculation needed (the participants are chosen randomly ), the he makes the calculation, if the participant can't get the calculation right it will be taken a fee in a form of a token (ETH), if the participant can get the calculation right it will get rewarded in a form of tokens (ETH).
because time is money in the crypto business, if a participant getting a lot of calculations right in the least time, more calculations will go to him.
