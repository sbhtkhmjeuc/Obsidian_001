# SMART Goals

- **Specific:**Â Make sure you define your goal carefully and clearly. For example, a goal could be organization, but a specific goal could be organization of your cubicle.
- **Measurable:**Â Include something in your goal that you can measure, such as a goal of organizing your desk, filing cabinet and floor within three months.
- **Achievable:**Â Find a goal that you are likely to meet with your current schedule. For example, if you want to organize your filing cabinet this month, make sure you have enough time each week to clean and organize one of the four drawers.
- **Realistic:**Â Ensure that you can actually meet the goal. Choose to organize one area of your workspace per week, rather than the entire cubicle, for example.
- **Time-bound:**Â Give your goal a time frame so that you can plan for your success. For example, if you plan to finish organizing before the first day of the next quarter, you know when you need to complete your last task to succeed at this goal.

You can Get SMARTER goals by adding:

- **Evaluate:**Â Choose a regular time to check on your goal's progress. For example, check every two weeks to be sure you have made progress on your project in order to achieve your goal.
- **Readjust:**Â Be prepared to change your plan as needed. If you get assignments that require overtime, for instance, be flexible and spread your project over the week instead.

# HARD Goals

- **Heartfelt:**Â If you want to learn a new skill, imagine the pride of having a new skill. Then, connect that pride with the goal and use that emotion as your motivation for learning.
- **Animated:**Â Visualize what achieving your goal would look like. Incorporate every sense that you can and imagine what it would sound, feel, smell or even taste like so you can remember the feeling every time you think about your goal.
- **Required:**Â If possible, connect your goal to something that's necessary for you. For example, if you want to learn public speaking, volunteer to present something on your company's behalf, as this obligation can motivate you to keep working on your goal.
- **Difficult:**Â Set a goal that challenges you. By doing this, you'll feel accomplished when you complete it.

# WOOP Goals

Some consider this an exceptionally helpful technique for **stopping a habit you might no longer want**.

- **Wish:**Â Make sure your wish is exciting for you. Imagine the sort of goal you would wish for and attach a positive feeling to the goal you want.
- **Outcome:**Â Imagine the best possible result of achieving your goal. Think of how you would feel if this happened and visualize it in as much vivid detail as possible.
- **Obstacle:**Â Consider what might prevent you or slow you down from success. For example, suppose you want to learn how to speed up your workflow, but you type slowly and this causes you to work at a slower pace.
- **Plan:**Â Find solutions to any obstacles that might interfere with your goal. If you have a slow typing speed, you can practice touch typing with software or websites intended to improve typing speed.

# OKR Goals

Stands for Objectives & Key Results, This type of goal is common among management who want to set goals that may affect the entire company. OKR goals are also helpful for large groups of people who need to work together toward a bigger goal. 

To set an OKR goal, choose a goal that you want to achieve, such as reaching 2,000 new customers by the end of the year. Then, identify the steps that can help you achieve the goal.

Assess and reevaluate your smaller goals as needed

# Micro-Goals

You can set multiple smaller goals that can help you achieve an overarching goal. For example, a sales team might use a visual representation of their extended goal, such as a thermometer chart that reaches $100,000. As they color in each smaller goal they achieve, which might be sales of $5,000, every participant can see how they are moving closer to the long-term goal

# Backward Goals

This type of goal-setting technique involves using your goal to help you decide what steps can help you reach that goal. For example, if you want a promotion, think about what that promotion may involve. **By working backward, you can take a large goal and make it more achievable.**

# Value-Based Goals

Goals may be easier to achieve if they align with values that are important to you.

For example, if you keep arriving to work late, but you consider responsibility an important value, set a goal of arriving on time and remind yourself that doing this is essential. If you want to be responsible and show others that responsibility is valuable, this may motivate you to complete this goal.

# ****Locke and Latham's five principles of goal setting****

- **Clarity:**Â Set clear goals you can measure and understand. Doing so helps you to achieve the goal and know when you've succeeded, which can improve motivation.
- **Challenge:**Â Make sure your goal requires effort to complete. Rather than setting a goal to attend one leadership seminar this year, set a goal to attend one per month, because a difficult task provides more motivation.
- **Commitment:**Â Find a goal that you want to accomplish. The more committed you are to achieving your goal, the more likely you are to complete it.
- **Feedback:**Â Check on your goal regularly and provide yourself ongoing feedback. If you can ask someone else for feedback, this may help even more and encourage you to stay on track to completing your goal.
- **Task complexity:**Â Be sure your goal isn't beyond your ability to complete. For example, if you don't know how to code but know it would help your career to learn, rather than set a goal of learning every coding language out there, instead choose one language and aim to become proficient in it.

# One-Word Goals

This technique emphasizes simplicity, Find one word that describes your goal and use that as your motivation.

or example, if you want to increase your personal sales quota, perhaps your one-word goal might be sell or connect,

# Visual Goals

Some people find it easier to use visual representations of their goals.

Imagine what your goal looks like and find a picture that represents it. Place your images where you might encounter them each day, such as your bathroom mirror or car dashboard. Use the picture as the background for your desktop or phone.
