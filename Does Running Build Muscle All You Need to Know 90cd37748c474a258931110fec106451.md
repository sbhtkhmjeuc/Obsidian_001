People run for a variety of reasons, including to reduce stress, improve health, and compete in races.

After 10 weeks of HIIT workouts 3 times per week, they showed close to an 11% increase in the muscle fiber area of their quadriceps (located at the front of the thigh), compared with the control group.

HIIT) involving 4 sets of running at near maximum capacity for 4 minutes followed by 3 minutes of active rest

workouts like sprinting may benefit muscle growth.

These results suggest that high intensity, short duration running builds leg muscles, while long distance running causes significant muscle damage, inhibiting muscle growth.

Muscle building occurs when muscle protein synthesis (MPS) exceeds muscle protein breakdown (MPB)

to build muscle, your body must make more protein than it removes

Exercise â€” primarily weight lifting â€” is a strong stimulus for MPS. Although exercise also causes MPB, the increase in MPS is greater, leading to net muscle gain

### Sample running workouts for building muscle

- 6 sets of 20-second sprints at maximum intensity separated by 2 minutes of walking or light jogging
- 5 sets of 30-second sprints at maximum intensity separated by 4 minutes of walking or light jogging
- 4 sets of 45-second sprints at moderate intensity separated by 5 minutes of walking or light jogging
- 4 sets of 30-second hill sprints separated by the time it takes you to walk back down the hill

Try to do these workouts 3â€“4 times per week

experts recommend consuming 0.64â€“0.91 grams of protein per pound (1.4â€“2 grams per kg) of body weight daily.

Water helps regulate body temperature and other bodily functions.
