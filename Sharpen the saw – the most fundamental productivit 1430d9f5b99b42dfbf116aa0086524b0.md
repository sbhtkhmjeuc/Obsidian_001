- the greatest asset you have in life is you
- which includes your energy levels, working and earning capacity, competences, daily motivation and so on.
- Taking care of your greatest asset - you, namely by preserving and enhancing your own agency
- The first one is to “put down the saw” which means taking enough time to rest and recover.
- The second is to “sharpen the saw” which represents taking good care of yourself and constantly investing in your development to keep improving and growing.
- during the break the older forester recovered his strength, and even more importantly, he sharpened his saw
- With his energy levels recharged and a much sharper blade, he managed to overtake his competitor
- that it’s better to work smart than hard, and to make sure you stay sharp in business.
- ever forget to sharpen the saw and put yourself first
- taking care of your body (the physical dimension), 
mind (mental dimension),
heart (emotional dimension) and 
soul (spiritual dimension).
- It all starts with the physical body
- There are five main ways to take care of your body:
- Groom yourself well
Get enough sleep (at least 7 hours every day)
Exercise regularly (at least three times per week)
Eat healthy
Put limits on work hours and stress
- Exercise is especially important.
- taking good care of our emotions can bring additional brightness and vividness to our daily existence.
- There are many things we can do to be emotionally fulfilled in our lives. Here are a few examples:
    
    Build strong relationships
    Have deep and meaningful conversations
    Make love
    Give service
    Meditate
    Find things to be grateful for every day
    Do at least one thing you enjoy per day
    Learn to manage negative thoughts and emotions better with cognitive-behavioral therapy
    
- You can’t be at your peak productivity if you don’t feel good about yourself and your work
- The most sought after and best paid skills are intellectual in nature
- Exercise is one of the best preventive measures for cognitive decline, and taking care of our emotions declutters our mind and leaves more bandwidth for productive and creative thoughts.
- life-long learning is a must.
- There are many different ideas how to take good care of your mind, such as:
    
    Read a book or listen to audio books
    Do an online course
    Do something completely new
    Do brain exercises
    Brainstorm ideas or visualizing your goals
    Create something artistic
    Plan, write or teach a topic
    Learn to program or brush up on your tech skills
    
- Here are some examples of activities that can help you take good care of your soul:
    
    Write down your life mission
    Contribute to a good cause
    Donate time or money or contribute to the local community
    Pray
    Forgive someone
    Coach other people
    Keep a journal and reflect on your life
    
- feeling a sense of self-actualization, belonging to something bigger than yourself and living a better world behind
- your productivity declines if you don’t take regular time off.
- You start making bad choices, you become much more anxious and impatient, your happiness levels drop, and you end up on the fast track to a burnout. You just can’t stay highly productive without proper rest and recovery.
- you need to get 7 - 8 hours of sleep
- Without proper sleep, your brainpower, physical fitness, mental bandwidth to make smart choices - everything goes down. In a big way.
- Then we have daily breaks. After every block of focused work lasting from 1 to 2 hours, you should take 5 – 10 minutes off.
- Stretch, practice deep breathing, browse funny photos of cats, take a power nap - it doesn’t matter. Just make sure you don’t only work, work, work, but also take some time to rest.
- That being said, make sure your little 10-minute pauses don’t turn into hour-long time‑wasting activities.
- Put a cap on how much you work on a daily basis.
- Put a cap on 9, maybe 10 hours of work per day, but make sure these hours are really productive.
- Take at least one guilt-free hour of play every day. No work, no chores, nothing. Just play.
- take one day in a week completely off.
- Then take an extended weekend off, for four days or so, every quarter.
- one or two big holidays per year, lasting at least a week - a whole week without any work to really fully recharge.
- To summarize, the general recommended time to take off is at least:
    
    10 - 15 minutes after a 1 – 2 hour work block,
    one day per week,
    one extended weekend (4 days) for every quarter and
    an additional two full-time weeks (14 days) a year.
    
- There are two ways you can take a break – an active and a passive version.
- A passive break means putting down the saw. In other words, doing nothing that takes any real physical or mental effort.
- Examples of passive breaks are taking a nap, sitting in a chair and enjoying rays of sunlight on your face, talking a really easy walk, etc..
- An active, smart break means sharpening your saw in one way or another and exploiting breaks to be more productive during your work time.
- Examples of active breaks could be reading a book, going for a more intense walk, watching an educational video, brainstorming ideas, stretching, cooking yourself a healthy meal, and so on.
- you have to decide how many active and passive breaks you will have.
- For example, doing exercise can be “sharpening the saw” if we do intense cardio to stay fit. But it can also be “putting down the saw” if we go for a slow walk in a nature to recharge our energy levels. Sometimes you need the first one, sometimes the latter.
- the idea is to consciously decide on the number of breaks you will take on a certain day and proactively plan which enjoyable things you’ll do during the time off.
- It must be the right combination of active and passive breaks, i.e. the right combination of sharpening and putting down the saw. You can help yourself plan your active and passive breaks with the list below.
- Examples of passive breaks – low physical or cognitive activity (putting down the saw):
    
    Taking a power nap
    Sitting or lying down and doing nothing
    Listening to music
    A slow walk in nature
    Watching a movie or TV show
    Easy video games
    
- Examples of active breaks – sharpening the saw during an active break:
    
    Moderate exercise, stretch or yoga
    Walking up and down the stairs in your office a few times
    Taking 10 deep breaths and practicing proper breathing
    Learning something new from somebody
    Reading, reading, reading
    Doing brain exercises
    Watching a documentary
    Preparing yourself a healthy meal
    Making a new entry in your journal
    Drawing something or doing some other type of art
    Learning a few new words in another language
    Organizing or cleaning something
    Having a deep and interesting conversation with someone
    Meeting somebody new
    Calling somebody you haven’t talked to in ages
    Writing down the things you are grateful for that day
    Planning your next trip
    Watching an inspiring video on YouTube
    Organizing your computer files and folders
    Decluttering your mail inbox
    Building your vision board on Pinterest
    Visualizing your goals
    Meditating for 15 minutes
    Reading inspirational quotes
    Doing a few eye exercises, especially if you work with a computer a lot
    
- Examples of investing in yourself – sharpening the saw considered as work
    
    Intense exercise
    Deliberate study, learning or practice
    Intense emotional reflection, etc.
    
- When taking an active break, make sure you don’t turn your breaks into real work,
- If other people keep improving and you don’t, you’ll fall behind.
