**The goal of incident response is to enable an organization to quickly detect and halt attacks, minimizing damage and preventing future attacks of the same type.**

there are 6 steps for incident response :

1. **Preparation of systems and procedures**
2. **Identification of incidents**
3. **Containment of attackers and incident activity**
4. **Eradication of attackers and re-entry options**
5. **Recovery from incidents, including restoration of systems**
6. **Lessons learned and application of feedback to the next round of preparation**

## Preparation

- review the current security measurements and policies to determine effectiveness.
- Preforming a **Risk Assessment** which determines what vulnerabilities are currently exist, and the priority of the assets to defense.
- after the risk assessment, the info that gathered used to  prioritizing responses for incident types.
- in this stage you can cover vulnerabilities by configuring the system, and focus the defense of the high-value assets.

## **Identification of threats**

- detecting and identifying any suspicious activity, when an attack s detected, team members need to work to identify the nature of the attack, itâ€™s source and the goals of the attacker.
- any evidence that is collected need to be protected and retained for later in-depth analysis.
- the people who responses for the incident need to document all of their steps, this can help to prosecute the attacker if will be identified.

## **Containment of threats**

**The goal is to advance to this stage as quickly as possible to minimize the amount of damage caused.**

there are two sub-phases :

**Short term Containment** - immediate threats are isolated in place, For Example a server that is infected may be taken offline and traffic redirected to a fail-over.

**Long Term Containment** - additional access controls are applied to unaffected systems, like cleaning , patching 

## **Elimination of threats**

- after the containment the teams are aware of the size of the attack.
- now the can eject attackers and eliminating malware from systems.
- this phase is continues until all traces of the attack are removes.

## **Recovery and restoration**

because the attacker wonâ€™t just attack for nothing, what the stole or encrypted, the recovery phase is al about, to recover those things.

- in this stage the teams are updating and replacing the systems online.
- this phase can take a while because the teams will monitor the system for some time to see that the attacker arenâ€™t coming back.

## **Feedback and refinement**

- members need to address what went well and what didnâ€™t and make suggestions for improvements.
