we'll talk about "Compound",
Users who want to lend tokens, lending their tokens and starting to earn interest according to the Supply APY, the supply tokens are sending into a smart contract, which will become available for Borrowers to borrow, in exchange for the supply tokens the suppliers will get a cTokens that represents the supply token plus the interest. 

in thins time in the market the loans are over collateralized, people can get loans because they don't want to sell their token and need to pay an expense, or avoiding or delaying capital gains or to use the borrowed funds to use as a leverage for a certain position.

to know the limit on how much one can borrow you need take the "Collateral Factor" which is a percentage that is multiplied by the collateral that the person sent, and the number that is get is the maximum value that the borrower can get. if the collateral is falling down below the lowest collateral level that is needed, the smart contract will close the collateral. 

the interest that borrower pay is that same interest that lender get on their funds
