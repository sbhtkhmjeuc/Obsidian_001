Why do you do what you do ? = What‚Äôs your purpose / cause / belief ? 

All of the regular people are talking from the outside-in (What ‚Üí How ‚Üí Why), but the inspired people and organizations talks from the inside-out (Why ‚Üí How ‚Üí What).

> *People don‚Äôt buy what you do, They buy why you do it.  -*Simon Sinek **

The goal isn‚Äôt to do business with people who needs what you have, the goal is to do business with people that believe what you believe.

the limbic brain is responsible for all of the feelings that you have (Loyalty & Trust), and the neocortex is responsible for all of the rational and analytical thought , when you are talking from the outside-in (in the circle) you are hitting the neocortex first talking in more figures and facts but don‚Äôt drive behavior, but when you are talking from the inside-out (in the circle) you are driving feelings and let people rationalize it with what we say and do.

limbic brain = your GUT.  (it doesn‚Äôt FEEL RIGHT)

> If you hiring people just because they can do a job, they will work for the money, but if you are hiring people that are believe what you believe, they will work
> 

People are buying a Belief

if you want to get to the 68% of the majority of the market, you need first to have all of the 15-18% of the market (the precent that represents that people who are getting the product as soon as it goes out called ‚Äú**Conversion**‚Äù). the people who are in the conversion get the product are having a **Gut feeling.** The 68% of the majority won‚Äôt try something unless some people are going to try it first. The 15% precent of the innovators and the early adopters are combatable to trust that gut feeling because it‚Äôs aligns with what they are believing in.
