# Evergrande‚Äôs $300 Billion Meltdown EXPLAINED The Lehman Brothers of China

The Evergrande Group is the Second biggest real estate company in China, they have a 305B Dollar in Debt because they are can not pay the interest on their bonds. Evergrande is currently building 2M homes in china and real estate that they are holding .Evergrande notifaid investors that they are gonna defult all their bonds, which tells that Evergrande can not pay for their Currenct project or on their home holdings, this move of defulting on currenct projects takes out joba from all the workers and all the people that involved in this project. And the people that holding the bonds are not going to profit from this as well.

this move of Evergrande can trigarre some senerios in which Evergrande can be ‚Äúsaved‚Äù : 1. Firesell all of their Properties - because Evergrande is such a big player in the Chenese property market, selling all of their properties is going to pump the market in supply which is going to set back the prices in the chinese property market. 2. Corp Bailout - Another company can save Evergrande, to take a big footstamp in china‚Äôs proerty market. 3. Gov Bailout - the chinese Gov can bailout Evergrande, but there is a problem with that, Peter Zeihan inhis book ‚Äúdis united nations‚Äù told that china is the biggest debt holder in the world that because China is comuniste which means that they are backing most of the large businesses in China, for example the chinese gov pick one of the steel companies and goves them a lot of money and tells then that from now they are the suppliers of the steel for china, because of this move the company have no reason to be efficiant as they should be like in a capitalistic society. in addistion of the largest debt holders, China also creates the biggest debt, because 685 of the new debt is to cover up old debt.

out of these three senarios, the most likely fo happend is the first one, which will hurt China to their Core.
