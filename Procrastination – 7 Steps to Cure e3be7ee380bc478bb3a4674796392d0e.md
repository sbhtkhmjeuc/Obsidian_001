To understand procrastination Piers Steel provide an equation :

 $Motivation = \frac{Expectancy * Value}{Impulsiveness * Delay}$

**Motivation** - The willingness to do work. 

**Expectancy** - How mush you expect to succeed at doing the task. (The more you expect being successful, you less procrastinate on it)

**Value** - How much you enjoy doing a task and itâ€™s reward.

**Impulsiveness** - the tendency to get distracted by other things. (High impulsivity is bad, it will alure you to get distracted more.)

**Delay** - id the time-lapse until receiving the anticipated reward on the task.

## Break Down the Steps

when you break down your tasks you are increasing expectancy, because the tasks are small youâ€™ll be more successful with it.  

Tip : For example if you are learning for a test next week, calculate the time that you are going to sit and study and set the subject to each sitting.  

**Figure out what work best for you.**

## Keep the Task Small

The hardest things about doing tasks is to START, you can use a Pomodoro timer, and break the times in to smaller pieces that you can. In Each Time Block. you are Focusing on only One Small Task.

This is helping increase Expectancy, because if Iâ€™m telling myself that I need to work for 4 hours, it will be overwhelming, but if I tell myself that I need to work for only 25 min, it will be Actionable.

## Hack Pleasure from the Experience of Studying

If you think that learning is boring, your value is low. To increase your value you can give yourself a reward **AFTER YOU FINISHED THE TASK**. 

**You can also improve the Experience of the work itself.** as you go on in the material the subjects are more focused on the more interesting subjects.
